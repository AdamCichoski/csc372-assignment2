  CSC372 - Assignment 2
</h1>
<p>
  This assignment for Web Development at UNCG requires that I create a home page (index.html) and a desination page (destination.html), along with a style css file containing all style design for the page. The site itself is a blog post, which in my assignment I chose to make about a trip I took to Switzerland. The trip is completely made up, I never took this trip.
