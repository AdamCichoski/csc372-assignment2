       Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Adam Cichoski and this is my blog for describing 
       travels across the world. I love to find and experience new places to visit, especially if 
       it means exploring nature, trying new foods, and meeting new people. Keep reading through 
       and exploring my page to find out about my experiences and travels around the world!

        my trip on my <a href="destination.html">desination</a> page.The most notable desinations
        that I visited while there were the Swiss Alps, Istelwald, Regionaler Naturpark Thal, Lausanne, 
        and Schrattenfluh.
