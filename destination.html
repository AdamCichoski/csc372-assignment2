            Overview
        </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Switzerland felt like stepping into a living postcard. Crystal lakes, tidy villages, and 
        the Alps towering in every direction. I hopped sleek tains from Zürich to Lucerne and 
        to car-free mountain towns, where cowbells and glacier views set the soundtrack. 
        Between fondue that actually tastes better after a hike and chocolate that ruins you for 
        all others, the country nails cozy and breathtaking at the same time. What surprised me 
        most was the blend of cultures—German, French, and Italian influences woven into everyday 
        life, all flawlessly punctual.

            Must See Spots

    <p>
        My top five favorit spots from this trip were the Swiss Alps, Istelwald, the Regionaler Naturpark Thal, 
        Lausanne, and Schrattenfluh.

            Visitor Tips
        </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Switzerland can be hard to navigate if it is your first time there, and even moreso if it 
        is your first time travelling in general. So to help, I have come up with a small list of tips 
        for any visitors. 
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Get around with the SBB Mobile app and consider a Swiss Travel Pass or Half Fare Card,
                it’ll save money on trains, boats, and mountain lifts
            </li>

            <li>
                Pack layers + good shoes: weather flips fast in the Alps, and the sun is strong at 
                altitude (bring sunscreen)
            </li>

            <li>
                Save francs by picnicking from Coop/Migros and refilling a bottle at public water 
                fountains (tap water is excellent)
            </li>

            <li>Trains run to-the-minute and many shops close Sundays—be punctual, and learn a few 
                basics in German/French/Italian depending on the region
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <div class="testemonial">
        <blockquote>
            I visited Switzerland and it was absolutely stunning. The trains were spotless and 
            on time, the lakes were crystal clear, and every mountain view felt unreal. I loved 
            grabbing fresh bread and chocolate, then riding a gondola for an easy hike with big 
            alpine views. Friendly, safe, and super easy to get around—highly recommend.
